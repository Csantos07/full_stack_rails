# What are ARRAYS?
# ----------------
#
# Arrays are collections of objects. They group objects in one place.
# Arrays are ordered collections of objects.
# 
# You can store any data type or object within an array. 
#
# - Numbers
# - Strings
# - Symbols
# - Boolean
# - Arrays
# - Hashes
# - Objects
#
#
# ex:
# My first array
# ---------------------------
# Assigning an array to variable
my_first_array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print "My first array: #{my_first_array}\n"
#
# Arrays are 0 index. To access the first element
# you would use the number 0 in square bracket notation.
# To access the second number you uses 1 in square bracket notation.
# ex. array_name[0]
# ex array_name[1]

# Accessing an element in the array 
# using square bracket notation
puts "Index 0: #{my_first_array[0]}" # => 1
puts "Index 1: #{my_first_array[1]}" # => 2
puts "Index 2: #{my_first_array[2]}" # => 3

# More Examples:
my_arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
list_of_fruit = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Tomatoes", "Kiwi", "Watermelon"]
