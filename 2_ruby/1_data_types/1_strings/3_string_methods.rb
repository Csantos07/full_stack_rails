# String METHODS
# --------------
# A String is an OBJECT like many things in Ruby. 
# Ruby is an Object Oriented Language.
# All objects can have methods.

# Methods also called functions are a big part of programming. 
# While we can create our own methods, and we will, we can also make use 
# of methods othere developers have created for us. 
#
# Because many programmers have faced having to repeatedly
# solve similar issues repeatedly, developers have created
# reusable solutions in the form of methods.
