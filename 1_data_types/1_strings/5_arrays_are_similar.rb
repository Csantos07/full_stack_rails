#
# Arrays are also a way to store a sequence of data
# Because strings are similar in the fact that both are a sequence
# We can use similar operations that we can perform on arrays.

# Accessing a character using square bracket notation
string_created_using_literals = "This is the actual string value"
puts string_created_using_literals[3] # should print -> "s"

alpha = "Hello"
puts alpha[1] # should print -> "e"

# The reason the [1] accesses the second item is that arrays 
# begin at the [0] index

# [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,] -> indexes
# ['H','E','L','L','O'] -> characters
