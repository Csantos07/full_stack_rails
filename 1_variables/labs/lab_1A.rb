# Write a small program to calculate how many minutes there are in a year. 
# Feel free to google the formula if you need help getting started.

minutes_in_a_year = 365 * 24 * 60

# Using variable names to improve clarity
days_in_a_year = 365
hours_in_a_day = 24
minutes_in_an_hour 60

minutes_in_a_year = days_in_a_year * hours_in_a_day * min
