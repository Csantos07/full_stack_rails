# What is a VARIABLE?
# -------------------
#
# A variable contains data.
# We can think of variables like a
# placeholder for a value or an alias for a value.
#
# Imagine having the value 3.141592653589793238. You may recognize this number as
# PI. Would it not be more convenient to refer to this number as PI rather
# than to have to write the whole number every single time. That is the 
# point of a varialbe. To have a more human readable form of some abstract value.

# Ex:

pi = 3.141592653589793238
origin = "(0,0)"
name = "Rizal"
language = "ruby"


# When you set the variable equal to something we call that assignment.
# laguage = "ruby" 
#################  # =>  We are assigning the string of ruby to the varible
#################  # =>  language.

# This OPERATION of assigning a value to a variable is called ASSIGNMENT.
