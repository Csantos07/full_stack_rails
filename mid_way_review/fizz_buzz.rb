# Fizz Buzz is a very simple programming task, asked in software developer job interviews.

# A typical round of Fizz Buzz can be: 
# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz”.
# if the number is a multiple of both ex. 15, print "Fizz Buzz" 

# PSEUDO CODE
# Count up to 100
# Need several checks
#   Is the number a multiple of 3, 5, of both
#   print the number, fizz, buzz, or fizzbuz
