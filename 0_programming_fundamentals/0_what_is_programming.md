Computers have improved daily life in previously unimaginable ways. From our phones to cars and even rockets landing on the moon are all thanks to computing. Every student in this class will change lives using technology from their fingertips. The individuals behind instructing computers are called programmers. The idea that a developer can tell a machine or device to do something is the beauty of programming.

Before we get to programming, we must understand how it works and an overview of what is going on in this fantastic yet intimidatingly massive ecosystem. This lesson will go over programming and look at the business aspects.
^overview

# Developers & Designers

In every IT industry, every individual has two choices; they can either be a designer or a developer. These roles may have different titles in each industry, but they personify the person behind them.

A designer designs the solution, what the final product will look and feel like. For web development, this is working on mock-ups and graphics for a website. For game development, this can be about game design, art, or level design.

A developer takes that design and implements it into a working solution. This role involves programming, infrastructure development, and any role that contributes to the development of a project.

There are two main reasons for a team to have separate developers and designers. The first reason is that it is much more efficient to have a developer working on a design while the designer is already designing the next prototype. The second is quality, a programmer does not necessarily have an eye for design, and a designer might not have the programmer's skills.

There is, however, a possibility that an individual has mastered being a designer and a developer. These are called "unicorn developers" or "unicorns" for short. We call them unicorns because they are rare and heavily treasured team members.

# Programming Fields

Programming fields are industries that heavily rely on computer programmers. Keep in mind that every industry that relies on technology will eventually involve a programmer. We might also add that any career that lives off of technology (like content creators) is also possible because of computer programmers. You can be the reason that jobs are created and transform livelihoods. 

Depending on which field a programmer may choose, they will have a very different experience among all other types of programmers. Choose wisely because each field has years' worth of learning and personal development.

As a bonus, each field has interviews with people to paint a better picture of each popular field that we will go over. The complete interviews can be found in the footnotes.

## Web Development

Web development is the hottest field right now. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that web developers and designers have a higher than average job outlook for 2020-2030[^1]. The two most extensive developer ecosystem surveys, JetBrains[^2] and Stack Overflow[^3], show that web development is the most adopted field.

Web developers have two focuses in this field. A frontend web developer focuses on developing an interface such as a website, mobile app, or client interacting with a server-side application. A backend developer creates a server-side application that the interface interacts with to perform logic.

In this field, there also can be multiple designers. The most common is a user interface/user experience designer, commonly abbreviated as a UI/UX designer. They focus on designing the interface and how it will feel before the web developer makes it.

JavaScript is the most popular language for this field. It enables developers to work on frontend and backend applications. A developer may find themselves making the frontend and backend. These are called "full-stack developers."

The video above is an example of web development with robotics. The frontend web developer would be responsible for creating the interface that communicates with code on the backend that controls the robot. In this case, Elian is a full-stack developer meaning they did both the interface and the code on the backend.

## Data Science

Data science is a lovely field for individuals that like visualizing data. The following video summarizes what data scientists do from a casual point of view.

Data science is a combination of computer science and data mining. It uses programming to visualize data to understand a product better. Data scientists can exist anywhere a business owner or organization wants to understand their customers, which applies to many industries. 

The creator of that video is Greg Bahm, and for our interviewee, we reached out to them. Greg Bahm has been working at Microsoft for eight years. He is a technical designer for the Hololens project.

> "I do consider data visualization to be an aspect of data science. Specifically, the aspect of data science where the raw data is converted into organized data and insights. I give a lot of presentations about data visualization, and most of my presentations involve some variation of this diagram:"

> "A data scientist can work their whole career simply collecting raw data. But that raw data goes to waste if it's not organized and turned into useful, accessible data stories. That's where the power of data visualization comes in." (Greg)

The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average salary of a data scientist is $98k[^4]. The study by the agency also shows that the job is secure with high employment.

Python is the most popular programming language in this field. Developers use it to analyze the data and create quick functions quickly. They can also go all out by developing a machine-learning algorithm to automatically understand current and future data.

## Game Development

Game development is the prettiest field from the outside, but a different story on the inside. The concept is simple: make a game. The actual functionality of a team is much more complex. Depending on the scale, there are many types of designers and developers in this field.

To understand designers of this field, we reached out to Nick "Vimlark" (alias), a content creator who focuses on the design of games and even creates his own!

-   https://youtu.be/DyVRjp0Nf7w?t=60

Nick would be considered a unicorn developer. Being capable of developing and designing his own game shows the value of his skills very well.

> "To me game development is the act of designing/creating an experience for other people. While books and tv can do the same, a game has a unique feature that the player dictates the progress. So the design has to be approached from a very different perspective." ... "To me there is nothing better than seeing someone having fun playing something I've made." ... "I have been lucky enough to live demo games at small conventions and seeing a group of strangers sit down to play and laugh never gets old."

We interviewed two other game developers to get their point of viewâ€”Jessie, a programmer, and ArmoredKori (alias), a game designer. In each interview, they bring up similar answers.

> "The high points are always the exciting moments where someone plays your game. It doesn't matter if they like it or not but being able to see someone experience something unique that you have created is indescribable. Watching their facial expressions as they progress through a level will always be on the top of my list of things I enjoy" (Jessie)

> "Seeing my work enjoyed and loved by people was and still is the highest part of the career. To know something you poured passion and love into brought joy to another human being is amazing." (ArmoredKori)

Although, it is significant to note that this is not a secure job. When asking what the lows of this field are, it is not easy and known for not paying well.  

> "It is like pulling teeth to get paid a livable wage" (ArmoredKori). 

> "I think specifically with game dev the low point is just trying to get into the door or trying to spend years developing a game just to get in that door" (Jessie) 

> "game development can be a grind at times" ... "Either people don't like it or it's broken." (Nick)

The most popular programming languages for this field are; Java, C#, and C++. It varies based on what the developer is trying to make. All of the creators here have a final message.

> "Just make things and don't be too precious with your work. Try out ideas, cut the things that don't work/aren't fun and focus on what does/is. The term "follow the fun" is a bit of a cliche but it is really easy to lose sight of it when focusing on mechanics and systems." (Nick)

> "Start making games as soon as possible. Always write up a postmortem of your games. Document your struggles and keep up with changing technologies. Try new things. Find the niche that fits for you and dig yourself a spot there." (Jessie)

> "The game development industry is immature. It ranges from one man shops to thousands of creatives coming together to make something wonderful. It's messy and filled with pitfalls." (ArmoredKori)

## The Takeaway

After looking at a high-level view of each of these fields, the takeaway is that it is not about knowing a programming language or specific technology. **It is about what you want to accomplish**. Yes, knowing a specific technology _does_ help you get a job, but you can not fake passion in this field. Learning a programming language is useless unless the developer knows why they want to use it; otherwise, the learning aspect will be challenging, and the efforts will be mediocre.

## Programming Languages

Most developers will find themselves learning multiple languages. That is why in "[[1.3 Language Overview]]," we will break down the characteristics of what goes into a programming language; this will enable us to pick up programming languages easily after the first.

# Applications & Solutions

When a developer has created anything using a computer or smart device, it is called an application or "app" for short. In business terms, these are sometimes referred to as a "solution." There are other names like software or programs, but they all mean the same. An app is one or multiple lines of code that a programmer has written.

# Libraries

It is common for programmers to share code with others or themselves across multiple projects. Reusable code is called a "module," "library," or a "package." For the most part, the common name is a "library." We will touch on libraries more when we utilize one.

# Lesson Summary

Programming is about writing code that instructs computers what to do. This industry is less about writing code and more about designing and developing what you want. There are many fields to choose from, and based on the field determines what technology or programming language to use. Programming languages are tools for a developer's success.
