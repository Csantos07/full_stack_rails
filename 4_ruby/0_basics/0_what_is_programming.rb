# What is PROGRAMMING:
# --------------------
#
# Computer programming is the process of performing a particular 
# computation, usually by designing/building an executable computer program.
#
# We usually think of the digital world when we think of programming,
# but computers and programming have taken many different shapes. 
# The first computers were more mechanical than digital.
